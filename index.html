        real-life problems with a strong and detailed focus on user experience,
        user interface, efficiency, and scalability.

        Previously, I have interned at Dotdash as a Software Engineer under the
        IAC Fellowship. I was also a freelance Web3 Engineer, with associations
        to Azuki and Everai. I have participated in several hackathon events,
        with a 3rd Place overall finish and Best Creative Design Award at
        Microsoft Hackfest and a Best Frontend Award at CTP HomeHacks.

        I graduated from Baruch College in 2022 with a BBA in Computer
        Information Systems. I supplemented my education with the CUNY Tech Prep
        fellowship program and self-studies with mainly TheOdinProject and
        FullstackOpen.

        I aim to create state-of-the-art technology for people around the world
        to use and to benefit from in their everyday lives. I want my products
        to be accessible and beneficial to people of all socioeconomic statuses
        in hopes of empowering living conditions around the world.

        I have a deep interest in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality
        technology. My hobbies include anime, basketball, filming, digital art,
        and traveling to explore the many cultures of the world.
